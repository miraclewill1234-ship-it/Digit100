        <p class="fade-in"> HEYYYY! its Miracle Wiilliams  im a DIGIT major I’m deeply passionate about UX/UI design
            and data visualization, where creativity meets strategy to shape how people experience
            and understand information. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been drawn to creative
            things whether through art, design, or finding new ways to bring ideas to life visually.
            I enjoy exploring how thoughtful design can make digital experiences more intuitive and
            enjoyable for everyone. With data visualization, I love turning complex information into
            clear, engaging visuals that tell a story and spark curiosity. Every project I take on
            is a chance to learn, experiment, and grow as a designer blending creativity and
            innovation to create work that truly connects with people.</p>
